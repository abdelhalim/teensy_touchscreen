To test the driver we will use a version of the firmware that draws a circle and
verify its output with the evbug module.

To begin compile the latest version of the driver module then install that
module. Next run `git checkout b214268aa91e665170d73cafb4f40000adb69de2` in
order to use older firmware that simply draws a circle. Now build the firmware
and install it on a teensy. You should probably `git checkout master` at this
point to return to current code.

Now lsmod and verify the teensy_touchscreen module is not loaded. Plug in the
teensy device and run lsmod again to check that the module was automatically
loaded. Next we need to load the evbug module (this module will need to be
selected when you build your kernel) so modprobe evbug. Now we can verify that
we receive data from the teensy properly. Run dmesg to see the evbug output.
Every 10 seconds we should see 36 vectors that draw a circle. Be careful with
evbug loaded as it will capture all input device inputs (passwords etc).

With the evbug data verified we can physically disconnect the teensy device. Now
rmmod the teensy_touchscreen module. Finally run dmesg to verify that the device
was properly disconnected in software and that the module was unloaded. You can
also verify the last portion with an lsmod.
