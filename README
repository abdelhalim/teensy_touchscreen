The Linux device driver module is GPLv2 licensed, and the firmware adapted from
PJRC's example USB Mouse code retains the original PJRC license.

The driver module makes great use of the existing
linux/drivers/hid/usbhid/usbmouse.c driver though it has been simplified to
work with this specific device and not explicitly use DMA in its URB. The
firmware uses a modified usb_mouse.c file so that at compile time the builder
can decide if the firmware should report as an HID mouse or not. The default is
to not report as an HID mouse allowing the linux device driver module to talk
to the device (otherwise Linux's HID driver takes over).

To build the driver run `make` in the driver directory. To have the module auto
loaded by usbcore you will then need to run `make modules_install` as root in
that directory.

To build and install the firmware you will need a teensy 2.0. To build the
firmware run `make` in the firmware directory. To install the firmware we use
PJRC's cli firmware loader. Run `teensy_loader_cli -mmcu=atmega32u4 -w
firmware.hex`. Press the button on the teensy and the firmware should be
loaded.
